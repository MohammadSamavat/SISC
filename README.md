# Neural_Computation_2024


Dear user,

Here are the codes for algorithm used in Samavat et al, Neural Computation, 2024. 

The code applied to samples collected from one feature. (Spine Head Volumes in CA1 in rat)

There are two essential dataset used for the algorithms. 

A. The CSV file that contains the IDs (names) of paired observations along with their values. 

CSV file name: pairs.CSV with four colomns as follows: (Feature_value_ID, Feature_ID)

B. The CSV file that contains the complete Sample of the observations for feature. 

CSV file name: Full_Sample.CSV with two colomns: (Feature_ID, Feature_Values)

Users put both CVS files in the same directory as the main file and click the Run botton in the main.R file.
